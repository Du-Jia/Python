At the Vogue Fashion Fund Awards in New York on November 2, 2015, Meghan modeled a daringly low-plunging dress designed by Misha Nonoo, who some speculate may be the person who introduced Meghan to Harry on a blind date in early July 2016. “We were introduced actually by a mutual friend,” Harry revealed during the couple’s first sit-down interview with the BBC following their engagement announcement.
